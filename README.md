# Cyclic Carousel.

Who doesn't like presenting cards on a screen?

What if you need to do this in SwiftUI?

Well, wait no more. Here you will find a sample code to achieve this.

## Requirements
- Written on xcode 11.4. 
- No extra requirements.

## Pending to do:

- [ ] Using `GeometryReader`, read the size already provided on each element to set it to the internal frame.
- [ ] Allow providing the footer and header, allowing the user customise if they want it top, center or bottom aligned.
